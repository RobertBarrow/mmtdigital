# Wiltshire Farm Foods - Strategy Outline document (May 2019)

There is some routine maintenance work to be had through the recommended Kentico updates and the regression test/fix cycle for the existing Microsoft Dynamics interface.  There is also some potential for development work around enhancements that are made possible by these updates, however the main focus for us this year is around the personalisation of the customer experience. This can be achieved through data analytics (website, email and social media interactions) and innovative technologies such as ChatBot/AI and Augmented Reality extensions.
