# WFF - Technical Strategy Plan (May 2019)

There is some routine maintenance work to be had through the recommended Kentico updates and the regression test/fix cycle for the existing Microsoft Dynamics interface.  There is also some potential for development work around enhancements and new functionality made possible by these updates.  However, the main focus for this account should be the personalisation of the customer experience. This can be achieved through data analytics (website, email and social media interactions) which can be used to generate recommendations, but also by introducing a new core feature, The "Meal Planner", and through the use of more innovative technologies such as AI ChatBot and Augmented Reality extensions.

## Maintenance

With a focus on security and the enablement of future development, we would recommend WFF upgrade their Kentico system to the latest (12.x) version.  Our proposition would be to spin up a cloud-based environment that mirrors their existing system (i.e. Kentico, webserver and MS Dynamics as per production environment).
We would then raise the baseline through the various versions, running the regression tests at each stage.
Every upgrade that passes should be recommended for promotion to production.  Note: Working with WFF IT team.

* Kentico upgrades - from 8.x to 12.x
* Microsoft Dynamics ERP - regression test, fix and deploy updates as required
* Potential for Microsoft SharePoint integration
* Some remodelling work based on MVC architecture
  
## Payments

Although their site already caters for major paymeny providers, there are 3 additional methods that should be recommended; PayPal, Giftcard and eVouchers.  The latter two are already targets for future development (as per the FAQ) and would make it easier for 3rd parties to contribute or fund the end consumer's account.
PayPal would also enable this and should be recommended as part of the same work package.

* Existing payment methods - Credit/debit card (MasterCard, Visa, Maestro and Solo), Cash, Cheque and Voucher (paper)
* Additional payment methods - PayPal, Gift Card, eVoucher code

## Personalisation

New Meal Planner and ChatBot functionality are great examples of how the data analytics can be combined with additional user interaction to tailor the customer journey and overall experience of using the WFF site.

* Data Analytics (search queries, page visits, purchase history, dietary requirements, demographics, geographics, devices)
* Targeted offers, discounts & eVouchers
* Tailored email marketing

### New Feature - Meal Planner

* Add Allergies and medical conditions (e.g. Celiac disease)
* Set Dietary preferences (e.g. low sugar/fat/salt)
* Browse recommendations
* ChatBot (AI backed up by 24/7 order line team i.e. chatbot can hand over to live chat)
* View Meal Planner
* Share Meal Planner
* Add Meal to Meal Planner
* Add Meal to Favourites
* Rate a Meal
* Review a Meal
  
## Framchisee support

We should recommend further development of the franchisee site so that it becomes more of an eLearning portal with lots of video based content.

## Apetito

There is lots of overlap between the WFF model and other B2B subsidiarys of the parent company, Apetito.
We should recommend a review of these other businesses to establish suitability for a re-skin/remodel of the existing WFF site.  There would likely be some additional work for delayed payments/invoicing.
There is also greate potential to develop a native smart-device app to leverage additional capabilities.
Lastly, we should recommend they look at some other home-based smart devices - esp. voice activation.

* Website re-skin/re-model for other B2B subsidiaries; Hospitals, Nursing homes, Nursaries, Local authorities
* Additional payment gateways/methods and delayed payment/invoicing model
* Greenfield App development project
* Voice assistant project
